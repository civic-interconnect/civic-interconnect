# Verticals

Verticals connect the core framework to real-world civic domains.

A vertical is a curated slice that brings together:
- relevant entities, relationships, and exchanges
- domain-specific vocabularies
- explanatory context about why the data matters
- governance assumptions that are explicit rather than implicit

Verticals do not change the core model.
They specialize it.

Each vertical answers a different question:
- What kinds of entities exist in this domain?
- What exchanges are meaningful here?
- What outcomes or concerns motivate analysis?
- What explanations are commonly required?

Verticals are intentionally modular.
They can evolve, split, or be retired without affecting other domains.

The framework distinguishes between:
- core reference material, which is stable and domain-agnostic
- vertical material, which is contextual, explanatory, and audience-facing

This separation allows:
- shared infrastructure across domains
- domain expertise without schema fragmentation
- comparison across sectors without forcing uniform interpretation

Implementation details, datasets, and examples for each vertical live in the repository.
The documentation describes structure and intent, not data snapshots.

Each vertical directory contains:
- an overview describing scope and purpose
- explanation pages that articulate domain-specific reasoning
- optional metadata files used by tooling and governance

Verticals are where neutrality meets use.
They provide meaning without embedding policy into the core.

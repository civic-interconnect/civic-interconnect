# How Verticals Work

Verticals define domain-specific applications of the framework.

A vertical selects:
- relevant entities, relationships, and exchanges,
- applicable vocabularies,
- and domain-appropriate explanations and outcomes.

Verticals do not change the core reference model.
They specialize it.

Each vertical may evolve independently, provided it continues to conform to the underlying reference layers.
This allows new domains to be added without destabilizing existing ones.

Vertical definitions live alongside, not inside, the core specifications.

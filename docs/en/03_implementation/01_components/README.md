# Components Overview

The framework is implemented as a set of loosely coupled components.

Each component has:
- A clear responsibility
- Explicit inputs and outputs
- No hidden side effects

Components may be implemented in different languages or runtimes.  
Interoperability is achieved through stable schemas and encodings, not shared code.

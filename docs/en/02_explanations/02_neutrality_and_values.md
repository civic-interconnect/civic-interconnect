# Neutrality and Values

The framework is neutral with respect to political, institutional, and policy outcomes.

Neutrality here does not mean absence of values.
It means that values are expressed explicitly, not implicitly encoded into data structures or algorithms.

The system distinguishes between:

-   factual records,
-   contextual evidence,
-   explanatory models,
-   and evaluative judgments.

This separation allows multiple value systems to coexist over shared data without forcing consensus.
It also allows disagreements to be articulated and examined rather than hidden.

Neutrality is maintained by design, not by claims of objectivity.

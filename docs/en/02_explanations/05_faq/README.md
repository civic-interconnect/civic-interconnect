# Frequently Asked Questions

This section addresses common questions about the framework from different
perspectives. The questions are organized by audience, but the answers are
intended to remain consistent and durable across contexts.

This framework is designed to make disagreement explicit rather than to resolve it.  
It separates structure, interpretation, and assurance so that different actors can
share data without being forced into consensus on meaning, values, or conclusions.
The intent is not to produce a single authoritative view, but to preserve provenance,
alternatives, and accountability over time. This allows systems built on the framework
to remain usable even as laws change, evidence evolves, or interpretations diverge.

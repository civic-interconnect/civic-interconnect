# FAQ for Practitioners

This framework is designed to make disagreement explicit rather than to resolve it.  
It separates structure, interpretation, and assurance so that different actors can
share data without being forced into consensus on meaning, values, or conclusions.
The intent is not to produce a single authoritative view, but to preserve provenance,
alternatives, and accountability over time. This allows systems built on the framework
to remain usable even as laws change, evidence evolves, or interpretations diverge.

## Is this another data standard I have to fully adopt?

No. The framework is intentionally modular. You can adopt schemas, identifiers,
or normalization rules independently without committing to the entire stack.

## Does this replace existing standards?

No. Existing standards remain authoritative within their domains. This framework
provides a way to relate, align, and preserve them together without flattening
their differences.

## How much work is required to get value?

Minimal adoption can be limited to structural validation and provenance capture.
More advanced capabilities (identity resolution, explanations, assurance) are
opt-in and incremental.

## What happens when rules or definitions change?

Changes are expected. The framework treats rules, vocabularies, and mappings as
versioned artifacts rather than fixed truths, allowing historical data to remain
interpretable.

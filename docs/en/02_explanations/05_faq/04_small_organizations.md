# FAQ for Small Organizations

This framework is designed to make disagreement explicit rather than to resolve it.  
It separates structure, interpretation, and assurance so that different actors can
share data without being forced into consensus on meaning, values, or conclusions.
The intent is not to produce a single authoritative view, but to preserve provenance,
alternatives, and accountability over time. This allows systems built on the framework
to remain usable even as laws change, evidence evolves, or interpretations diverge.

## Is this only for large institutions?

No. The framework is explicitly designed to scale down. Small organizations can
use only the parts that provide immediate value.

## Will this increase reporting burden?

The goal is the opposite. By separating structure from interpretation, the same
data can satisfy multiple reporting needs without duplication.

## Do we need specialized staff?

No. Most usage aligns with existing data and governance practices.

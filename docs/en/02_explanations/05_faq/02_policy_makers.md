# FAQ for Policy Makers

This framework is designed to make disagreement explicit rather than to resolve it.  
It separates structure, interpretation, and assurance so that different actors can
share data without being forced into consensus on meaning, values, or conclusions.
The intent is not to produce a single authoritative view, but to preserve provenance,
alternatives, and accountability over time. This allows systems built on the framework
to remain usable even as laws change, evidence evolves, or interpretations diverge.

## Does this framework promote a specific policy position?

No. It is explicitly neutral with respect to policy outcomes. It focuses on how
information is structured, traced, and compared, not on what decisions should be made.

## Can this be used across jurisdictions?

Yes. Jurisdictional differences are treated as first-class inputs rather than
exceptions, allowing lawful variation without forcing harmonization.

## How does this support accountability?

By preserving provenance, versioning, and alternatives, the framework makes it
possible to trace how conclusions were reached and which assumptions were applied.

## Does this require legal or regulatory changes?

No. It is designed to operate within existing legal frameworks and reporting
requirements.

# Why Category Theory

Category theory is used as a descriptive and organizing tool, not as a prerequisite for use.

The framework employs categorical ideas to reason about structure, composition, and equivalence across domains.
These ideas help ensure that transformations are well-defined and composable.

The use of category theory supports:

-   clear separation of objects and relationships,
-   explicit transformation pipelines,
-   and principled reasoning about normalization and equivalence.

Readers do not need formal training in category theory to use the framework.
The theory informs the design; it is not imposed on users.

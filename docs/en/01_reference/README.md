# Reference

This section defines the stable reference model for the Civic Interconnect framework.

Reference material is normative where stated and descriptive elsewhere.
It defines concepts, structures, and responsibilities that other parts of the system depend on.

The reference is organized into layered parts:

-   Civic Accountable Entities (CAE)
-   Civic Exchange Protocol (CEP)
-   Contextual Evidence and Explanations (CEE)
-   Assurance

Each part can be read independently.
Later layers may build on earlier ones, but earlier layers do not assume the existence of later layers.

This section avoids implementation detail.
Code, data, and tooling examples live in the repository and are referenced, not duplicated, here.

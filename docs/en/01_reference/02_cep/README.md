# Civic Exchange Protocol (CEP)

The Civic Exchange Protocol (CEP) defines how civic facts are represented,
linked, and exchanged across systems.

CEP specifies structural contracts for expressing civic information in a way
that is interoperable, verifiable, and durable over time.

CEP does not define policy meaning, evaluation, or outcomes. It defines how
facts are structured so that such work can occur elsewhere.

## Scope

CEP specifies:

-   Entity records
-   Relationships between entities
-   Exchanges of records
-   Record envelopes for transport and validation

CEP does not specify:

-   Identity resolution strategies
-   Explanatory or evaluative models
-   Domain-specific semantics beyond structure
-   User interfaces or workflows

---

## Design Intent

CEP is designed to support long-lived civic data ecosystems.

Its structures are intended to be stable across jurisdictions, domains,
and implementation languages, while remaining extensible.

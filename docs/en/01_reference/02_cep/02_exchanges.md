# Exchanges

An exchange represents the transmission or publication of civic records.

Exchanges are concerned with _what was shared_, _when_, and _by whom_, not
with the meaning or correctness of the content.

---

## Exchange Role

Exchanges provide structural context for records.

They allow systems to reason about provenance, timing, and scope without
embedding those concerns into entity or relationship records.

---

## Exchange Contents

An exchange may contain:

-   Entity records
-   Relationship records
-   Metadata describing the exchange itself

CEP does not require that exchanges be complete or authoritative.

---

## Repeatability

Exchanges are immutable once published.

Revisions are represented as new exchanges rather than modifications.

This page defines how civic data moves through CEP-compliant systems.

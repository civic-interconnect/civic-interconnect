# Identity and Reference

Identity in CAE is concerned with reference, not proof.

CAE does not attempt to determine whether two actors are truly the same.
It defines how claims of sameness or difference can be expressed and compared.

## Identity References

An identity reference is any stable token used to point to an actor.

References may be internal or external, local or global, strong or weak.

CAE does not privilege any single identifier scheme.

---

## Identity Comparison

CAE allows systems to compare references to determine whether they are
believed to refer to the same actor.

Comparison is always contextual and may change as evidence changes.

CAE does not define a single resolution algorithm.

---

## Persistence

Identity references may persist even when attributes change.

CAE supports longitudinal reasoning by separating identity from description.

This page defines the boundaries of identity handling within CAE.

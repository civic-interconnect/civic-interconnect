# CAE Overview

Civic Accountable Entities (CAE) defines the foundational object universe for the broader framework.

CAE provides:

- A disjoint partition of civic entities into a small set of kinds.
- Admissible relationship families between those kinds.
- A stable basis for reference and longitudinal reasoning.

CAE does not define exchange formats, evidence models, explanations, or evaluative claims. It is designed to stand alone.

## The Entity Partition

CAE partitions entities into six disjoint kinds:

Actors (A)
Sites (S)
Instruments (I)
Events (E)
Jurisdictions (J)
Observables (O)

Disjoint means an entity instance is classified into exactly one of these kinds within CAE.

The partition is structural. It is not a moral or legal taxonomy, and it does not attempt to capture all real-world nuance. The purpose is to provide a stable basis for interoperability and accountability reasoning.

## What CAE Is For

CAE exists to make accountability-bearing structure explicit.

Higher layers may express exchanges over CAE entities, and may attach evidence and explanation to CAE-grounded records. But those layers must not change the entity partition or reinterpret what kinds of things CAE permits.

## What CAE Does Not Do

CAE does not:

- Determine whether two records refer to the same real-world thing.
- Validate legality, legitimacy, or authority claims.
- Encode causal claims, policy judgments, or outcomes.
- Provide domain-specific enumerations of all civic entity types.

CAE defines the structural vocabulary needed for systems to refer to civic entities and reason about their relationships over time.

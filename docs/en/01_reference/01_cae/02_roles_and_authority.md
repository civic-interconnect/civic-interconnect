# Roles and Authority

Roles describe how a civic actor participates in a given context.

Authority describes the capacity in which that role is exercised.

CAE treats roles and authority as contextual properties, not intrinsic ones.

---

## Roles

A role is a function an actor performs within a specific situation.

An actor may hold multiple roles simultaneously or sequentially.

Roles are not globally fixed and do not define identity.

---

## Authority

Authority represents the recognized capacity to act within a role.

Authority may be legal, administrative, customary, or asserted.

CAE does not validate authority. It only provides structure for recording
that an authority claim exists.

---

## Separation from Identity

Holding a role or authority does not change who an actor is.

CAE intentionally separates identity from role to avoid collapsing
context-specific behavior into permanent classification.

---

This page defines how participation is represented without redefining actors.

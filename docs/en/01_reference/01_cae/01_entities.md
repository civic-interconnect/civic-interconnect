# Civic Actors

A civic actor is any entity that can participate in civic processes.

This includes, but is not limited to, individuals, organizations, public bodies,
and collective entities.

CAE does not classify actors by legal form or jurisdiction. It defines only the
structural requirements for referring to actors consistently.

---

## Actor Existence

An actor exists in CAE when it can be referenced.

Existence does not imply legality, legitimacy, or authority. It only implies
that some system has reason to refer to the actor as a participant.

---

## Actor Attributes

CAE does not mandate a fixed attribute set for actors.

Attributes such as names, identifiers, locations, or classifications may exist,
but CAE treats them as descriptive, not defining.

No single attribute is sufficient to define identity.

---

## Actor Stability

Actors may change over time.

CAE does not require that an actor remain static, only that references to the
actor can be compared and reasoned about across records and systems.

This page defines what it means for an actor to exist within CAE.

# Assurance

The Assurance layer defines how confidence, verification, and claims about civic
data are represented.

Assurance does not determine correctness. It records _who asserts what_, _under
which conditions_, and _with what evidence_.

---

## Scope

Assurance specifies:

-   Attestations about data, processes, or interpretations
-   The structure of claims and supporting evidence
-   Provenance of verification activities

Assurance does not specify:

-   How data is collected
-   How interpretations are produced
-   Whether a claim should be trusted

---

## Role in the System

Assurance operates alongside interpretation, not above it.

Different actors may issue incompatible attestations over the same material
without contradiction.

---

## Neutrality

Assurance records claims without endorsing them.

Trust is evaluated externally by consumers.

# Attestations

An attestation is a structured claim asserting that a condition holds.

Attestations express confidence, verification, or compliance with respect to
some object, process, or statement.

## Nature of Attestations

Attestations are:

-   Explicit claims
-   Attributable to an issuer
-   Bounded by scope and time

They do not assert universal truth.

---

## What Can Be Attested

An attestation may concern:

-   Data integrity
-   Process execution
-   Methodological adherence
-   Review or audit completion

The subject of an attestation is always explicit.

---

## Evidence and Basis

Attestations may reference evidence, procedures, or standards used.

The presence of evidence does not imply sufficiency.

---

## Coexistence

Multiple attestations may exist for the same subject.

Disagreement is expected and preserved.

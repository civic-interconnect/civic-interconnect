# Outcomes and Explanations

CEE distinguishes explanations from outcomes.

An explanation describes reasoning. An outcome represents a decision or action.

---

## Separation of Concerns

CEE stops at explanation.

Outcomes belong to governance, policy, or operational layers outside CEE.

---

## Benefits of Separation

This separation:

-   Preserves analytical neutrality
-   Enables reuse across contexts
-   Supports plural decision frameworks

---

## Interoperability

Explanations may inform multiple outcomes without being rewritten.

CEE ensures explanations remain portable civic artifacts.

This page defines the boundary between reasoning and action.

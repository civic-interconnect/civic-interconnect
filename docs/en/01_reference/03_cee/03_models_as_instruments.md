# Models as Instruments

CEE treats models as instruments rather than authorities.

A model is a tool applied to data to generate observations or explanations.

---

## Instrumental View

Models are:

-   Purpose-specific
-   Limited in scope
-   Replaceable

No model is considered universally valid.

---

## Comparison and Coexistence

Multiple models may operate over the same data simultaneously.

CEE encourages comparison rather than convergence.

---

## Provenance

Models must be identifiable and versioned.

Their assumptions and limits must be externally inspectable.

This page defines the role of models within CEE.

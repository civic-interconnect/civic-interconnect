# Explanations

An explanation connects observations to an interpretive claim.

Explanations articulate _why_ an observation is considered relevant or
meaningful within a given context.

---

## Characteristics

Explanations are:

-   Contextual
-   Contestable
-   Explicit about assumptions

CEE allows multiple explanations for the same observation.

---

## Separation from Outcomes

An explanation is not a decision or recommendation.

It provides structured reasoning that may inform outcomes elsewhere.

---

## Accountability

Each explanation is attributable to a model, method, or author.

CEE treats explanations as civic artifacts subject to scrutiny.

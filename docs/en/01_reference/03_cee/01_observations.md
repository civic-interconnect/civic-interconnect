# Observations

An observation is a derived statement about civic data.

Observations summarize or transform underlying records into forms suitable
for analysis or interpretation.

## Nature of Observations

Observations are:

-   Derived, not raw
-   Context-dependent
-   Reproducible given the same inputs and rules

An observation does not assert meaning or intent.

---

## Relationship to Data

Observations depend on underlying civic records but do not modify them.

They may aggregate, filter, normalize, or otherwise process records.

---

## Stability

Observations are versioned artifacts.

Changes to derivation logic result in new observations rather than mutation
of existing ones.

This page defines how facts are transformed into analyzable signals.

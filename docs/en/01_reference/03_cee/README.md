# Contextual Evidence and Explanations (CEE)

The Contextual Evidence and Explanations (CEE) layer defines how civic data is
interpreted, contextualized, and evaluated.

CEE operates above structural data representation. It does not define facts.
It defines how facts are used to support understanding, reasoning, and
decision-making.

## Scope

CEE specifies:

-   Observations derived from civic records
-   Explanations that connect observations to interpretations
-   Models treated as instruments rather than truth claims
-   Context tags that scope meaning and applicability

CEE does not specify:

-   Data schemas or record formats
-   Identity resolution mechanisms
-   Policy outcomes or normative judgments

---

## Design Intent

CEE is designed to support pluralism.

Multiple explanations may coexist for the same underlying data without
conflict, provided their context and assumptions are explicit.

The following pages define the core components of CEE.
